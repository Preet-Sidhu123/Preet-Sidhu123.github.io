            <p>Disaster risk reduction (DRR) is a systematic approach to identifying, assessing and reducing the risks of disaster. It aims to reduce socio-economic vulnerabilities to disaster as well as dealing with the environmental and other hazards that trigger them. Here it has been strongly influenced by the mass of research on vulnerability that has appeared in print since the mid-1970s as well as the mapping of natural disaster risks. Disaster risk reduction is the responsibility of development and relief agencies alike.</p>

         <p>In many parts of the world, flooding is a major problem. In the period from 1970 to 2012, storms and floods caused over one million deaths (Atlas of Mortality and Economic Losses from Weather, Climate and Water Extremes, WMO, 2014). Flood plains are often attractive areas for human development and a vast share of the worldâ€™s population depends, whether directly or indirectly, on a number of key natural resources that are generally provided by floodplains. </p>

         <p>A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. On Earth, volcanoes are most often found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging, and most are found underwater.</p>

      <p> All thunderstorms give rise to sudden electrical discharges in the form of lightning and they often bring rain and gusty winds. Severe thunderstorms are associated with all or combinations of heavy rain,  large hail, very strong winds and occasionally tornadoes or snow. Tornadoes are particularly common in the Great Plains of North America but they can and do occur anywhere, especially in temperate latitudes. Their extremely strong rotating winds can cause severe damage.  </p>

   <p>Massive and devastating fires can be triggered during and after periods of drought, by lightning or by human action in almost all parts of the world. As well as destroying forests, grasslands and crops, they kill livestock and wild animals, damage or destroy settlements and put the lives of inhabitants at risk.  </p>

   <p>Tropical Cyclones are one of the biggest threats to life and property even in the formative stages of their development. They include a number of different hazards that can individually cause significant impacts on life and property, such as storm surge, flooding, extreme winds, tornadoes and lighting</p>
