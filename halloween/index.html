            <h1 class="py-4">About Halloween</h1>
            <p>Halloween or Hallowe'en (a contraction of "All Hallows' evening"), less commonly known as Allhalloween,
                All Hallows' Eve or All Saints' Eve, is a celebration observed in many countries on 31 October, the eve
                of the Western Christian feast of All Hallows' Day. It begins the observance of Allhallowtide, the time
                in the liturgical year dedicated to remembering the dead, including saints (hallows), martyrs, and all
                the departed.</p>

            <p>One theory holds that many Halloween traditions were influenced by Celtic harvest festivals, particularly
                the Gaelic festival Samhain, which are believed to have pagan roots. Some go further and suggest that
                Samhain may have been Christianized as All Hallow's Day, along with its eve, by the early Church. Other
                academics believe Halloween began solely as a Christian holiday, being the vigil of All Hallow's Day.
                Celebrated in Ireland and Scotland for centuries, Irish and Scottish immigrants took many Halloween
                customs to North America in the 19th century,and then through American influence Halloween had spread to
                other countries by the late 20th and early 21st century.</p>

            <p class="mt-5">Popular Halloween activities include trick-or-treating (or the related guising and souling),
                attending
                Halloween costume parties, carving pumpkins into jack-o'-lanterns, lighting bonfires, apple bobbing,
                divination games, playing pranks, visiting haunted attractions, telling scary stories, and watching
                horror or Halloween-themed films. Some people practice the Christian religious observances of All
                Hallows' Eve, including attending church services and lighting candles on the graves of the dead,
                although it is a secular celebration for others. Some Christians historically abstained from meat on All
                Hallows' Eve, a tradition reflected in the eating of certain vegetarian foods on this vigil day,
                including apples, potato pancakes, and soul cakes</p>

            <h1 class="text-center pt-3">Trick Or Treat Around The World</h1>
            <p>Many countries recognize this as a traditional activity on Halloween. Some cultures offer candy, while a
                few offer money. A lot of children also utter the phrase “trick or treat” as they knock on doors. The
                trick isn’t performed very often so it’s sort of a ritual. In North America, trick-or-treating has been
                around since the 1950s. If a homeowner decorates their front door with Halloween accessories, and leaves
                the porch light on, then that’s usually an indication that they have candy to give out. </p>

            <p>Many countries recognize this as a traditional activity on Halloween. Some cultures offer candy, while a
                few offer money. A lot of children also utter the phrase “trick or treat” as they knock on doors. The
                trick isn’t performed very often so it’s sort of a ritual. In North America,trick-or-treating has been

                the porch light on, then that’s usually an indication that they have candy to give out. </p>

            <p>Ireland, Canada, the UK and the US, and Puerto Rico celebrate Halloween this way. Central and
                Northwestern Mexico also have it. People there call it Little Skull and kids ask: Can you give me my
                little skull? They will receive a small skull-shaped candy in sugar or chocolate. Prior to 1940, the
                term trick or treat was used mostly in Canada and the US. The term was introduced to the UK in the
                1980s, but often it’s not welcome. In Ireland and Scotland dressing up and being given sweets is
                considered normal on Halloween.</p>

            <p>Dressing up and going door to door in Scotland started around 1895 and costumed children and adults would
                take lanterns made from turnips to each house and after knocking on the door, receive fruit, cakes, and
                money. Boys used to visit some of the wealthier homes in the 1920s, where the benefits were no doubt
                more generous. Dressing up and going door to door on Halloween is still popular with the Irish and the
                Scots. In the US, churches may sponsor Trunk or Treat which is done in a parking lot. Parents feel this
                is safer as kids visit different car trunks and receive candy and decorations.</p>

            <p>Treats received when trick or treating have changed throughout the years because of changing society. It
                used to be in the fifties, that children enjoyed homemade candy apples or homemade brownies or cookies
                Everything now is made safer by pre-wrapped and manufactured candy being doled out to the
                trick-or-treaters. If a homeowner wants to show a bit of individualism on Halloween, they can purchase
                treat bags and insert four of five pieces of candy into them, then seal with a little Halloween sticker.
            </p>

            <p>Individual bags can be made by purchasing brown bags from a craft store and then decorating them. This
                would work if they’re aren’t a hundred children stopping by. It’s a wonderful idea for a home thrown
                party and these hand decorated bags and homemade candy will be enjoyed as party favors by children, for
                as long as it takes them to eat the treats. Most estimates put that around an hour after the kids get
                home.</p>

            <p>If children go out into a neighborhood trick or treating, the youngest ones should be trailed closely by
                a parent. If older children or teens go in a group then all candy should still be checked at home. This
                can be why a party and candy treats are perhaps best enjoyed at home, where everyone knows each other.
                Children enjoy designing and making treat bags. They also enjoy choosing the candy to go in them. A
                little age-appropriate toy is also nice, plus perhaps a gold chocolate coin to celebrate those more
                ancient traditions of giving money.
